# The-Walking-Head
human has to walk at least 10Km (6miles) a day in order to awake its brain (John Medina, Brain Rules) .

Next office:

The country side or any place.
Sitting the whole day in a close place behind a screen is a non sense.
So 
- 4 to 5 guys teams
  Walking the whole day (with random and convenient rests and pauses)
  Speaking toghether
    with 
      off line speech recognition
